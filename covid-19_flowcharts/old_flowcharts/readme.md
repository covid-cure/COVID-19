#### flowchart 1

Countries, states, cities, counties and neighborhoods should be able to be programmed into a virus. You could maybe even program the time of day into the virus. However, I will assume that the Coronavirus is not that sophisticated that it was programmed with precise longitude and latitude coordinates of places to infect. I will entertain this concept more deeply, but it looks like it is not possible for the Coronavirus to have programmed coordinates of various places to infect.

#### flowchart 2

I think COVID-19 enters a human host, and then performs a series of checks to determine if the host is a suitable candidate for infection. If the test return favorable conditions to infection, then COVID-19 will infect the host. If not, COVID-19 will exit out of the host. After infection, we then know what demographic group is vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, and which group is not vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.

The virus does not know what age group it infects nor the biological sex of the person it infects. The virus appears to have a preference for the elderly demographic the majority of the time. Since it does not know who or what is an elderly person, it could be relying on identifying various things that typically happen to an elderly body such as low vitamin and mineral levels, low muscle mass, high fat, low hormone levels, or other factors that are typically present in elderly people.

#### flowchart 4

The health module is going to be difficult (but not impossible) to construct. I will not be using any actual medical data that has been analyzed for meaningful relationships across demographics to construct it. I will, however, use known bat behavior to construct it. This should not be that difficult. A goal for the moment, is to find out why exactly the Coronavirus has an affinity for some elderly people and not others. Several things can be said about the elderly such as they are weak or they have weak immune systems or some other medical condition. The goal then is to narrow down the reason as much as possible to where a predictable algorithm can be generated.


The conjunctive disjunctive phrase, "((INFECT AND SPREAD) OR GO TO STOP)" added. I do not have any particular reasoning for adding the phrase other than an organism should continue wanting to spread even while it is infecting a host.

#### flowchart 5

I might have to change the location of the Elderly Submodule. We know who gets infect after COVID-19 has entered a human to find a viable host. COVID-19 does not know how to distinguish demographics in the way that we can distinguish demographics using visual cues. For example, humans can look at another human and usually determine their age group as well as their biological sex. 

COVID-19 cannot perform these functions like humans can perform them. COVID-19 can, however, use evolutionary mechanisms to determine a suitable host. COVID-19, by infecting very elderly people so aggressively, has shown that it can possibly determine a suitable host to infect by checking that certain elements are at low levels or that certain elements such as cancer and diabetes are present, to then cause an infection. Thus far, COVID-19 has shown that it aggressively prefers elderly human bodies to infect.

I think, based on COVID-19's infection behavior, it is able to differentiate age groups to infect by reading the growth hormone levels of the host, and the sex hormones of the host mainly, while giving consideration to other levels such as vitamins and minerals or other diseases. Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, and Iron levels could be possible elements that COVID-19 can analyze on a molecular level, to then determine who to infect at full force. There could be other elements that are analyzed to determine a suitable elderly host, but growth hormone and reproductive hormones are likely hormones that could be used by COVID-19 to determine a host to infect. This could explain why it is infecting elderly people very aggressively. It has found a familiar environment with them. The other familiar environment is a diabetic environment. COVID-19 appears to show a very strong preference for infecting diabetics even if the host is not old. This could mean that the bat DNA in COVID-19 was extracted from very old bats that were diabetic, or many diabetic bats that were both old and young and male and female.

There are not too many children that are diabetic so this could account for their virtual immunity. Children also have high levels of growth hormone. So one of these things or both or other factors could give rise to children being practically immune to COVID-19. However, other factors that can be considered are possibly related to the pregnancy of their mother, antibodies that were passed from mother to child during birth, and maybe even colostrum.

#### flowchart 7

I might have to add a fat level check. From various reports floating around online, young people that have succumb to the Coronavirus appear to have done so because they were overweight. More specifically, they were obese or morbidly obese. From these actions by COVID-19, we can infer that it checks for fat levels, but it might assign them a greater priority over other levels, so if a person has relatively high levels of human growth hormone or high levels of human growth hormone, but the same human host also has very high levels of fat, then COVID-19 might unleash its full force on a molecular levels because it has decided that it must remove the excess fat because this excess fat is putting its flight ability in danger. Bats require the ability to fly. If they cannot fly, they risk dying out. So, they must remain virtually fatless.

Narrowing this down further, bats require all the effects that result from the ability to fly. If these effects could be simulated inside the bat's body in a scientific controlled setting, the bat should think it has engaged in flight, when it has not actually engaged in flight. Thus, its survival is ensured without achieving flight, and its DNA's survival instincts should remain stable. Upon DNA remaining stable, the potential life extending benefits associated with bat flight, along with a few other benefits, should be able to be achieved in a controlled repeatable way. Simulating all of the effects involved in bat flight appears to be a viable cure to diabetes as well as a viable cure to obesity. One way to perform this simulation in the human body would be through nanotechnology. 

The tiredness that people feel when they contract COVID-19 could be several things, but it can definitely be the human body feeling the effects of flight simulation as a bat would perform the bat flight. Evidently, from various articles that I have been reading about bats, bat flight is very energy demanding, so bats have to compensate for this demand by being very light and having high blood sugar levels.

If you introduce the effects of bat flight to humans, and they are not aware of it, they could feel the same energy drainage associated with bat flight and they will feel very tired. More tired than they have ever felt before.





In software engineering, we can assign a priority to an element using a priority queue.
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue

Thus, hypothetically speaking, COVID-19 may assign a higher priority to determining fat levels of the host than it does to determining growth hormone levels. From this we can infer that the Coronavirus, on a molecular level, will place a greater priority at neutralizing threats that increase its weight that are not related to growth hormone. Excess calories cause weight gain that can be stored as fat. Growth hormone does not necessarily cause weight gain that can be stored as fat.

From this, it can be inferred that bats might have a potential treatment for obesity or some type of treatment to lose weight just like bats might have a potential treatment for diabetes or high blood sugar levels.
