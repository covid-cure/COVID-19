## COVID-19 has Earth Origins

Since COVID-19 (Coronavirus) originated in planet Earth, the cure must exist within planet Earth. A problem arises because does the cure exists in any location on planet Earth, or does it exist at the location where COVID-19 originated? I think the location can exist anywhere on planet Earth. The location has to be discovered. For the time being, I am going to assume that the original place of origin has not yet discovered the cure or treatment to COVID-19 Coronavirus. The flowcharts will only focus on the Coronavirus' behavior as it travels through the air in search of a host to help it survive. It survives by infecting a host. The goal obviously is to not let it infect a human host. 

## Preliminary Result of COVID-19 Software Breakdown

- potential cure or treatment to diabetes found within the behavior of COVID-19 before it infects a person (this concept is software within software)
- potential cure or treatment for obesity or being morbidly obese found within the behavior of COVID-19 before it infects a person
- there could be other potential cures or treatments as a result of being able to safely harness the effects of bat flight, and apply these effects to various human ailments within the human body while the person is living
- these potential cures are valuable to a certain extent; they could explain why China has behaved the way it has since the pandemic began
- parts of their research got leaked, this is the current iteration of COVID-19 and they have been trying to obfuscate its real intentions using propaganda and other means
- with their allies in the American media, their allies in the NBA and other sports organizations, they have pretty much shifted the narrative using Americans business institutions, and their little virus fades into obscurity, meaning their research is safe from being taken by other countries and losing out on the cures
- Bill Gates was especially active, and the models they used to predict the death tolls could have been part of the effort to increase propaganda while the Chinese hid their real research and prepared to profit from the current iteration of COVID-19
- developing a cure to diabetes or other ailments is also financially valuable, China would want to use whatever tools it had to hide this potential cure
- COVID-19 gave off the vibe that it was an unfinished science project, that could be because it is a potential cure for various ailments, and it was released in some intermediate stage of testing
- maybe whomever released it, misunderstood it, or saw potential profit, but there is more money to be made with a diabetes cure and a viable treatment for obesity
- there's also the fame factor, you can gain more saying you cured diabetes while at the same time, saying you also developed a treatment that treats obesity and also lets people eat whatever they want without consequences of getting fat, getting diabetes, or getting other ailments that result from eating too much food


## COVID-19 Alternative Scenarios for Bat Research

- The Chinese might be searching for a cure for diabetes as well as a treatment for obesity or a weightloss treatment. Life extending benefits could result from this treatment/research. Their research project got out, who knows how, but I have read a few stories on it. Lo and behold COVID-19 is born.
- There could be other reasons the Chinese are so heavily focused on bats for research purposes. The respiratory issues surrounding their bat research appear to not be the main focus of their research. I say this because the Chinese, maybe all scientists, would not be researching bats so intensely, if there was not a greater reward available from the research. 
- An actual cure to diabetes or a treatment using nanotechnology would be a greater reward worthy of striving for.
- The scenario exist that China would have used or did use Italy as testing ground to learn more about their virus. Based on whatever the Chinese learned from observing Italy, they probably would have adjusted their geopolitical strategy for any future issues related to the Coronavirus from other nations. I am still not too sure what the Chinese were expecting from America.
- I am currently thinking deeply about Nanotechnology and how it could be related to COVID-19.
- After doing some thinking, assuming this technique of controlling high blood sugar levels in humans using the components of bat flight, but not the actual bat flight itself actually works to control high blood sugar levels, then the possibility exist that this ability could allow humans to eat whatever food they want without ever having to worry about high blood sugar levels.
- Further, the effects of bat flight, but not the actual act of flying, could also result in the ability to not gain fat. It could also result in the ability to lose fat.
- I will try to apply the same approach to other respiratory diseases that came out of China to see what else can be discovered on a hypothetical level that can then be matched to various Chinese political and geopolitical behavioral cues to then see what the Chinese could be working on related to advances in highly sought after technology and cures. It is safe to assume they are working on something, given all the respiratory diseases that come out of China. Perhaps we can find out what they might be trying to do. 


## Rare Cases

## Bat Behavior Modules

- social behavior - bats are social animals for the most part. I think this aspect of their behavior is ingrained in their DNA because it has helped them survive as a species. However, I am still uncertain if the Coronavirus would be able to detect infected humans, to then make itself stronger because it thinks it has found another bat in close proximity, so it should display more bat behavior while inside the human host. I still need to think more deeply about their social behavior. Parsing this thought out onto "paper" is challenging, lol. 
- being social might be programmed into bat DNA. At the initial stages of the pandemic, Italy created a political correctness campaign called "Hug a Chinese". Many Italians were labeled as racists if they did not hug a Chinese person. Some scientists then claimed that being politically correct might have caused their COVID-19 cases to go up. So, if the Coronavirus is easily transmissible between people and is highly contagious, and the Italian government passes a "Hug a Chinese" political correctness campaign, then bat DNA might be able to become stronger if it senses other nearby bat DNA. This module is very tricky.
- For what it is worth, China had not informed anyone of how easily COVID-19 spreads between people, so Italy was really caught off guard.

- Fears of being called 'racist' harmed Italy's coronavirus response, says leading Italian virologist Italy's first two confirmed cases of coronavirus were Chinese tourists from Wuhan https://rmx.news/article/article/fears-of-being-called-racist-harmed-italy-s-coronavirus-response-says-leading-italian-virologist

- TONIGHT: CHINA URGED ITALIANS TO 'HUG A CHINESE', NOW BLAME AMERICA FOR VIRUS https://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/tonight-china-urged-italians-to-hug-a-chinese-now-blame-america-for-virus/news-story/a887b893a684cda3ba5f7f4e05793786

__The Big Question:__

- Did China instruct Italy or guide Italy in some form to launch their campaign of "Hug a Chinese" (or You're Racist) knowing how easily and fast the Coronavirus spreads and knowing it can have fatal results for certain demographics?

__More Stuff on Italy:__

- https://twitter.com/MichaelPSenger/status/1270925788389486593
-  CCP launched a massive social media campaign in ITALY to advertise its coronavirus lockdown measures in early March.

__Possible explanation for the propaganda from the CCP:__ 

Retribution for someone leaking their potential cure for diabetes and obesity as well as the ability to eat whatever you want without fear of gaining fat/weight. Retribution is a strong word. Perhaps call it spite instead.

On the software side of COVID-19, we can code a module to regulate high blood sugar levels in a software simulation. The expectation is to be able to create a high blood sugar level regulating mechanism to see if COVID-19 can perform this function in real life. I think it would regulate them by using up the excess blood sugar until blood sugar levels are stabilized.

How does COVID-19 know what the approprite blood sugar levels should be? For now, we assume that the DNA in COVID-19 is relying on years of evolutionary experience that it will not immediately change even if it has been manipulated in a scientific setting. This just means that it would take a lot of effort to change its behavior, so for now, it is best to work with its behavior to understand what it is forcing the human body to do, on a hypothetical level of course.
