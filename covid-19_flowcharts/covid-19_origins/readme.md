- China Stands Accused of Manufacturing the COVID-19 Virus https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/08/china-stands-accused-manufacturing-covid-19-virus/

(*I could believe that headline. Their behavior since the beginning of the pandemic was indicative of them believing they had the upperhand. The entire thing seems personal as well. I think they really did want to stick it to America and the world with their little virus. Maybe they even wanted to make the Americans beg for their help.*)

#### random thoughts related to COVID-19 origins

The entire COVID-19 response from China seems contrived in that the way they behaved has been way too weird for it to not standout and for anyone to not notice. 
I will assume that they knew that others would notice that they seeded the virus to the rest of the world using airlines as delivery conduits. 

Why risk alienating yourself and your people by allowing an amateurish decision like that to be made?

I will assume that they knew others would notice their behavior of hoarding supplies from the rest of the world, including America.

I will assume that they knew others would notice their behavior of hoarding medicines and potential therapeutics from the rest of the world.

Why risk alienating yourself and your people by allowing an amateurish decision like that to be made?

What could China be working on that is worthy of keeping secret to the point where it risks alienating itself and its people from the rest of the world? 

What could be this valuable to China that it felt it was acceptable to harm all diplomatic and economic relations with the rest of world?

I will assume that part of COVID-19’s response from China has been half true and half propaganda designed to cause instability. I’ll develop this later.

The Coronavirus came from China, that part has been established. What hasn't been established, at least publicly, is if this was supposed to be the thing that came out of China? 

Was it supposed to be made public at all? Was COVID-19 a backup plan in the event the real project was compromised? 

Was COVID-19 designed to buy the Chinese enough time to hide their real project?

I will assume that COVID-19, while true and a documentable event with a virus that has a somewhat reliable algorithm of behavior, might be part of a disinformation campaign by China, using its assets, to hide their real project and the real intentions of their project.

None of the assumptions listed hide the fact that COVID-19 is a particular type of tool with a particular type of potential. The hard part is ascertaining how much of this potential China knew about, and how much of it they kept secret.

By now, it should be plainly obvious that all medical data and DNA data, particularly of Americans and of Americans in various positions, should be heavily guarded from hostile nations or hostile actors or just heavily guarded in general.

#### The Big Questions

- Why would China risk so much over the Coronavirus? It seems as if they were acting very confidently in the beginning. Did the climax not happen in America because of President Trump's leadership? Right now, it looks like President Trump threw a major wrench in China's plan, whatever that plan was.

- What scientific project or research is China working on that it would go to great lengths to keep it a secret, even ruining diplomatic and economic relationships in the process? 

- What single thing (or things) are this valuable to them?

I still haven't decided what aspect of the Coronavirus could be a smokescreen to hide other research, but if it centers around bats, and bats are known for living a long time, and I am sure the Chinese are aware of this, then the scenario exist for the possibility that the Chinese could be doing research into aging.


#### Something Changed

> This is not good. I had my doubts about Xi's identity when he went into hiding during the initial stages of the pandemic in China. I also thought President Trump and President Xi were cool (as cool as foreign relations let you be anyways).

- "I had a great relationship with President Xi. I like him, but I don’t feel the same way now.” @realDonaldTrump said his relationship with #XiJinping has frayed in the wake of the #CCPVirus pandemic and that he has not spoken to Xi in a long time. https://twitter.com/news_ntd/status/1293390503292084225
- President Xi Jinping appears to have baited and played with President Trump, so that Xi's candidate and personal asset, Joe Biden, can win the White House in 2020. 

#### Alternative Scenario

If after extensive investigations using whatever means available, it is revealed that there is no big secret research project that China was working on or tried to develop to then protect the project's existence at all costs, then their thought-process and decisions should be evaluated to see if they would fall in line with President Xi's behavioral tendencies in relation to decision-making. Ideally, their entire decision-making thought process and his should be evaluated before the pandemic started, at the initial stages of the pandemic, during the height of the pandemic, and after the height of the pandemic. The decision making process from China, thus far, seems amateurish. Is it within President Xi's realm of expertise to make amateurish decisions that have a global impact?

__Why make such amateurish decisions that have a global impact, and why go into hiding during the initial stages of the pandemic in China?__
